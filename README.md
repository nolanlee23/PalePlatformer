A simple 2D platformer project for both CS583 and to learn about core functions of game development through python.   
Inspired by Hollow Knight in movement and style, pixel art is drawn by me!   
Lots of credit to @DaFluffyPotato on YT, he made most of the foundation and helped me understand everything well.
