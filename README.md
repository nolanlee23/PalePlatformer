A simple 2D platformer project for both CS583 and to learn about core functions of game development through Pygame.   
Inspired by Hollow Knight in movement and style, player pixel art is drawn by me.   
Lots of credit to @DaFluffyPotato on YT, he made most of the framework (game loop, tilemap, entity physics) and    
helped me understand how to build off of that base.
