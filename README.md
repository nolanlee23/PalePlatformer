A 2D platformer project for both CS583 and for learning about core functions of game development through Pygame.   
Inspired by Hollow Knight in movement and visual style, sound effects and music are from the original game.     
All player animations, entities, and particles are drawn by me.      
Lots of credit to @DaFluffyPotato on YT, he made most of the base framework (game loop, entity movement, particles, camera movement) and helped me learn and understand how to build off of that base.
