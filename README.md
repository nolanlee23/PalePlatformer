A simple 2D platformer project for both CS583 and to learn about core functions of game development through Pygame.   
Inspired by Hollow Knight in movement and style, entity and particle pixel art is drawn by me.   
Lots of credit to @DaFluffyPotato on YT, he made most of the base framework (game loop, entity movement, particles, some tilemap) and    
helped me learn and understand how to build off of that base.   
Help save all of the grubs while exploring the forgotten labrynths deep underground!    
Controls:    
A, D = Left and right movement    
W, S = Look up and down    
SPACE = Jump, Wall jump, Double jump    
SHIFT = Dash
